## Environment Setup
You need to install both nodeJS and bower dependencies first. Run the following two commands:
```
npm install
```
and
```
bower install
```

Also, you need to replace the file in `/bower_components/vega-lite-ui/` with files from `/vega-lite-ui`, just copy and paste/replace. This contains the customized version of `vega-lite-ui`.

If everything runs smoothly, you can run `npm start` now to start the application, it will open your browser with url:`localhost:3000` automatically.
